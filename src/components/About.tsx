            The story behind KOZE

            <p>
              KOZE was started by two former colleagues from the tech industry, after we experienced how a colleague was fired due to anxiety that prevented him from being able to handle the job in a stressed sales environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              It got us thinking â€“ and we decided to create a product and brand that offers both physical comfort (through weighted hoodies) and emotional support (through a community and openness about mental health).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to help people find peace in a hectic everyday life. We believe that small things can make a big difference to our mental well-being.
